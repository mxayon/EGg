## Emotional Gauge Game
Game and lesson tracking tool for learners with developmental learning disabilities.

Ruby on Rails full-stack web app with a strong relational database. Uses Highcharts to map out mood and age of learners, engaging learners with CSS-Animate and a basic HTML5 canvas game.

###Why?
* the ultimate inter-activity!
originally wanted a game but instead chose to focus on interacting with each learner - ipads are great but its more important to use it as a utilize it as a tool to interact with them on a more engaging level.
